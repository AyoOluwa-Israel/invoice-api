## Project Structure

This project follows a standard Go project layout to enhance organization and maintainability. Here's a breakdown of the key directories and their purpose:



* **`pkg/`**
    * Contains reusable packages that can be imported and used by other Go projects.
    * These packages provide general-purpose functionality that might be useful in various contexts.

* **`config/`**
    * Stores configuration files for your application, such as database connection settings, API keys, or environment-specific variables.

* **`models/`**
    * Defines the data structures and models used in your application, often representing database tables or API responses.

* **`controllers/`**
    * Handles the logic for processing requests, interacting with models, and generating responses.

* **`utils/`**
    * Contains helper functions and utilities that are shared across different parts of your application.

* **`routes/`**
    * Defines the routes and endpoints for your application, mapping URLs to specific controllers and actions.

* **`db/`**
    * Manages database connections, migrations, and interactions with the database.

* **`go.mod` and `go.sum`**
    * Essential for Go module management.
    * `go.mod` defines the module's path, dependencies, and Go version requirements.
    * `go.sum` stores checksums of the dependencies to ensure build reproducibility.

* **`README.md`** (this file)
    * Provides project documentation, including instructions on how to install, use, and contribute to the project.

* **`LICENSE`**
    * Specifies the license under which your project is distributed (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL).

**Additional Notes:**

* You might also encounter other directories like `test/` for unit tests, `docs/` for additional documentation, or `examples/` for code examples.
* The structure can be adapted to fit the specific needs of your project.
